Description of the Icy Tower
=============================
Icy tower is a single player platform game which user controls the character for jumping on platforms quickly. Game starts at the bottom of the icy tower, and the player tries to jump to the bars at the above without falling and getting more points by sliding at the walls which is on the leftmost and rightmost of the screen. The player has to maintain a speed that must be higher than the speed of the game screen goes up.

The gamespace is a vertical area which continuously moving up and contains platforms. The character can jump on those platforms to move up. The platforms will have different types of instances such as thin, hardly visible, slippery.

The player can control the character for moving left and right, and jumping with the keys he/she choose (left arrow, right arrow and space bar by default). 

The player will have a score that depends on the altitude and level. There will be 3 levels (easy, medium, hard) that affects the speed of moving up of the system.
